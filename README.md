# Why did you make this?

I wanted something tiny to sneak into shows and such. A full-sized dug-out just felt like it was too conspicuous. I got it down to about the size of a lighter. It holds a 3" one-hitter, and about 3/4 of a gram, which for me is more than enough for a night out.

# Any recommended print settings?

I 3d-printed it from ABS at 100% infill. If you're not a fan of ABS, PLA would probably be fine. 

# Your design is stupid, and I've made it better.

Great! Upload your changes and I'll gladly incorporate them.
